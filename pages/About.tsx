          Hi, I'm <strong className="text-slate-200">Brandon Currie</strong>, a maker based in <strong className="text-slate-200">Leonardtown, MD</strong>. I've been 3D printing and modeling for over <strong className="text-slate-200">7 years</strong>. 
          What started as tinkering with a basic kit printer has grown into a passion 
          for functional design and rapid prototyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          I specialize in functional parts—things that fix problems around the house, 
          organize messy desks, or replace broken components that you can't buy anymore. 
          I appreciate the blend of engineering precision and creative freedom that 
          additive manufacturing provides.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is simply a gallery of the work I'm proud of. It's not a store, 
          and I'm not a factory. I just like making cool stuff for the local community and beyond.
